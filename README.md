# PE Track: Week 2 - Emilie Zhang - Portfolio Site

## Introduction

As part of TEAM PYTHONIC from Pod 22.SUM.21 of the Production Engineering Track at MLH Fellowship, I have forked our previous project to personalize.

For week 2, I plan to personalize the team portfolio then host it via Digital Ocean with the creation of a droplet.

## Description

This is a reusable portfolio template which can be easily adapted to any number of team members. It is also mobile-friendly, which is an important feature considering that 50%+ of traffic on the web comes from mobile devices.

Team Pythonic's portfolio website consists of two main components:

###### Landing page

- Animated heading text to display team name
- Medium subheading, animated text to display team info
- Profile pictures of each member which leads to their respective profile pages

###### Profile page

Cards with relevant profile sections, including:
- About me
- Experience
- Projects
- Countries I've visited: Interactive Google Map with markers of locations each member has visited
- Hobbies: Hover effect tooltip boxes which display more information

###### Additional features

- Landing page with pop-up CSS animations when user hovers over main text
- Fully responsive website that adjusts according to screen size and works on mobile screens
- Animated menu bar for switching profiles

## Visuals

## Technologies used in the project

- The Python microframework Flask
- HTML/CSS and Bootstrap
- Jinja for templating (injecting Python code into HTML)
- JSON for storing our data
- JavaScript for the menu dropdown and map creation
- Google Maps API in JavaScript to mark locations visited in each profile page

## Installation

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed

Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv
```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create a .env file using the example.env template (make a copy of the file, then replace the values if required)

*Note: Add your own Google Maps API key in the .env file in order to use the map functionality*

Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

You should get a response like this in the terminal:
```
❯ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You'll now be able to access the website at `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` in the browser! 

*Note: For now, the portfolio site will only work on your local machine while you have it running inside of your terminal. We plan to host it in the cloud in the next few weeks!*
